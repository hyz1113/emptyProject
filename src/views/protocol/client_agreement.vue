          RISK WARNING: Trading leveraged derivative products such as Foreign
          Exchange (Forex), Contracts for Difference (CFDs) or other financial
          derivative products carries a high level of risk to your capital. All
          these products, which are leveraged derivative products, may not be
          appropriate for all investors. The effect of leverage is that both
          gains and losses are magnified. The prices of leveraged derivative
          products may change to your disadvantage very quickly, it is possible
          for you to lose more than your invested capital and you may be
          required to make further payments. Before deciding to invest in any
          financial product, you should carefully consider your investment
          objectives, trading knowledge and experience and affordability. You
          should only trade in Forex and CFDs if you have sufficient knowledge
          and experience of the risky nature of the products, the risks involved
          in trading such products and if you are dealing with money that you
          can afford to lose. You should seek independent professional financial
          advice if you are in any doubt.

            18.2.4 Technical difficulties could be encountered in connection
            with the Trading Systems. These difficulties could involve, among
            others, failures, delays, malfunction, software erosion or hardware
            damage, which difficulties could be the result of hardware, software
            or communication link inadequacies or other causes. Such

            event will STARTRADER or its affiliates or any of their employees be
            liable for any possible loss (including loss of profit or revenue
            whether direct or indirect), cost or damage including, without

            executed Transactions (including Transactions that have been
            confirmed or settled) to a fair Market price if the Transaction was

            18.2.5 Internet, connectivity delays, and price feed errors
            sometimes create a situation where the price displayed on the
            Trading Platforms do not accurately reflect the Market rates. The
            concept of "arbitrage" and "scalping", or taking advantage of these
            internet delays, cannot exist in an over-the-counter Market where
            the client is buying or selling directly from the Market. STARTRADER
            does not permit the practice of "arbitrage" on the Trading Platforms
            and considers this improper use or abuse of our trading Platforms.
            Transactions that rely on price latency arbitrage opportunities may
            be revoked. STARTRADER reserves the right to make the necessary
            corrections or adjustments on the Account involved. STARTRADER may
            take any action we deem reasonable to recoup losses incurred as a
            result of the use of electronic algorithmic trading systems or any
            other means utilized to exploit technical deficiencies or palpable
            errors. Accounts that rely on arbitrage strategies may at
            STARTRADER's sole discretion be subject to STARTRADER's intervention
            and STARTRADER's approval of any Orders. Any dispute arising from
            such quoting or execution errors will be resolved by STARTRADER in
            their sole and absolute discretion.

        dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower
        volatility means that a security's value does not fluctuate
        dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period of
        time. Forex, CFDs, Spread Bets and Currency Options are all exposed to
        volatility risk and are complex, high risk investments. Losses can

      <div class="paragraph">
        The General Risk Disclosure Notice ("the Notice") is provided to you in
        accordance with Applicable Regulations on the basis that you are
        proposing to trade on STARTRADER's trading Platforms in CFDs and Forex,
        which are leveraged products, incur a high level of risk and can result
        in the loss of all your invested capital.

      <div class="paragraph">
        It should be noted that the Notice does not contain all the risks and
        aspects involved in trading Forex and CFDs; therefore, you need to
        ensure that your decision is made on an informed basis taking into
        consideration the following points below.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">2. General Risk Warning Notice.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Forex and CFDs are leveraged derivative products, which are "complex"
        products. Complex products are Financial Instruments with structures
        that make the risks and likelihood of return more difficult to
        understand, including Platforms giving access to complex products, are
        also likely to be considered complex. A complex Financial Instrument
        requires a greater level of experience and knowledge of the underlying
        risks involved. This includes derivative instruments such as Forex and
        CFDs.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        You should have sufficient knowledge and experience in trading such
        leveraged derivative products. You should not trade in leveraged
        derivatives unless you understand the risky nature of the contract you
        are entering into and the extent of your exposure to risk.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        You should also be satisfied that the contract is suitable for you in
        the light of your personal circumstances and financial position. You
        should not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Before deciding to participate in the Forex or CFD Market, you should
        carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and
        risk appetite. You should seek independent professional financial advice
        if you are in any doubt.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        When trading in Forex and CFDs there is considerable exposure to risk in
        any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, including, but not
        limited to, Leverage risk, credit risk, Market volatility, weekend,
        holiday and overnight risk, Exchange risk and abnormal Market conditions
        that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency or

        Leverage Risk
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          2.1.1 Unlike traditional trading, trading forex and CFDs means that
          you are able to trade the Markets by paying only a small percentage of
          the total trade value when opening a position referred to as "Margin".
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.1.2 Due to the leveraged nature of Forex and CFD products, any small
        Market movement can lead to a proportionally much larger movement in
        value of your position, which can work against you as well as for you
        and you could lose all or more than your initial Margin.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.1.3 As the possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of
        or more than your initial margined funds and that the Margin on all open
        positions must be maintained at the required level in order to keep any
        position opens, you may be required to deposit additional funds to
        maintain your open position.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.1.4 If a position moves against you and reduces your balance so that
        you are below the required Margin level on a particular trade, you will
        be subject to a "Margin Call" and will have to pay additional money into
        your account to keep the position open. If you fail to meet any Margin
        requirements, your position may be liquidated, and you will be
        responsible for any resulting losses.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.1.5 To manage exposure, you can employ risk-management strategies such
        as 'stop-loss' or 'limit' orders, however you must know that such
        strategies are not guaranteed. It is your responsibility to monitor your
        account and ensure that the required Margin is available on your account
        at all times.

        2.1.6 STARTRADER may provide leverage ratios dependent on the level of

        may apply to certain Products, Platforms and/or jurisdictions, as
        indicated on the official website of STARTRADER.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">

        right to decrease the leverage depending on the client's trade volume.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">

        2.1.8 There may be specific maximum leverage limits and/or Margin

      <div class="paragraph">2.2 Margin requirement</div>
      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.2.1 You need to ensure that you have sufficient Margin on your trading
        account, at all times, in order to maintain an open position. In
        addition, you need to continuously monitor any open positions in order
        to avoid positions being closed due to the unavailability of funds; it
        should be noted that STARTRADER is not responsible for notifying clients
        for any such instances.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.2.2 If the circumstance arises that the Margin on your account falls
        below 150% (one hundred and fifty percent) of the account equity you
        will receive a warning notification in your STARTRADER MetaTrader 4
        Platform. At this point you should consider either closing positions or
        sending in additional funds to cover your positions. If you do fail to
        meet the Margin requirements and your account equity falls below 100%
        (one hundred percent) of your required Margin, STARTRADER has the
        discretion to automatically close your largest open positions (referred
        to as "Stop-Out") at Market price until your equity is above the 100%
        (one hundred percent) minimum. This is a risk-mitigating mechanism
        employed by STARTRADER to attempt to stop your account from falling into
        a negative balance. However please note we do not guarantee that your
        account will not fall into a negative balance, particularly in adverse
        Market conditions.

        Credit Risk
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          2.3.1 When trading CFDs the client is effectively entering into an
          off-exchange or over-the-counter ("OTC") transaction, this implies
          that any position opened with STARTRADER cannot be closed with any
          other entity.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        2.3.2 OTC transactions may involve greater risk compared to transactions
        occurring on regulated markets, for example traditional exchanges; this
        is due to the fact that in OTC transactions there is no central
        counterparty and either party to the transaction bears certain credit
        risk (or risk of default).
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Abnormal Market conditions
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          2.4.1 Under abnormal Market conditions, Forex and CFD prices may
          fluctuate rapidly to reflect unforeseeable events that cannot be
          controlled either by STARTRADER or the client. As a result, STARTRADER
          may be unable to execute the client's instructions at the declared
          price and a 'stop loss' instruction cannot guarantee to limit the
          losses at the set "Stop Loss", this can lead to "Slippage". This may
          occur for example during the following scenarios:
          <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
            <span class="indent"></span> During or when the Market opens; and/or
            During news times; and/or
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
            <span class="indent"></span> During times of Market volatility, for
            example political uncertainty, where prices may move significantly

        Rolling Spot Forex<br/>
        Rolling spot Forex is both a future where the underlying instrument
        being traded is foreign exchange or sterling or it is a contract for
        difference where the profit is secured or a loss is avoided through
        fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in either case the contract
        is entered into for speculative purposes. A rolling spot forex contract
        can be "rolled" indefinitely and no currency may be actually delivered
        until the position is closed. This exposes both parties to fluctuations
        in the underlying currencies.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Spread Bet<br/>
        Spread betting is a type of trading that involves taking a bet on the
        price movement of a security. You would generally be quoted two prices,
        the bid and offer price (also called the spread), and you bet whether
        the price of the underlying stock will be lower than the bid or higher
        than the offer. You will never own the underlying stock in spread
        betting, as you are simply speculating on the price movement of the
        stock.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Currency or Forex options<br/>
        Currency or Forex options are derivative financial instrument that gives
        the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specific currency, at
        a specified exchange rate on or before a specific date. You must also
        realize that when buying options means you could lose the entire option
        investment should the option expire worthless.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Contracts for Difference (CFD)<br/>
        A CFD is an agreement to exchange the difference between the opening and
        closing value of a contract when closed. Rather than buying or selling
        the underlying instrument on which your contract is based, you simply
        place a

      <div class="paragraph">
        trade on our trading Platform. The price of your CFD will then replicate
        the price of the underlying asset (without actually owning the
        underlying product) giving you a profit (or a loss) as the price of the
        underlying moves, so that the amount of any profit or loss made on a CFD
        will be equal to the difference between the price of the underlying
        instrument when the CFD is opened and the price of the underlying
        instrument when the CFD is closed, multiplied by the number of
        underlying instruments to which the CFD relates.

      <div class="paragraph">
        CFDs are a way of trading on the upward or downward price movements of
        traditional financial markets without buying or selling the underlying
        asset directly. The potential losses associated with the price movements
        can exceed the total value of the initial margin (and any additional
        margin funds) you have deposited with us, and you may be obliged to
        close your positions at the worst possible time.

      <div class="paragraph">
        CFDs are contracts that can be entered into in relation to Commodities
        or the FTSE-100 index or any other index or share, as well as Currency.
        Investing in a CFD carries risks similar to investing in a future or an
        option and you should be aware of these. Transactions in CFDs may also
        involve a contingent liability and you should be aware of the

        one of the riskiest forms of investment available in the financial
        Markets and is only suitable for sophisticated individuals and
        institutions. Given the possibility of losing an entire investment,
        speculation in the foreign exchange Market should only be conducted with
        risk capital funds that if lost will not significantly affect your
        personal or institution's financial wellbeing.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Foreign Markets<br/>
        Foreign Markets involve different risks from Markets. In some cases,
        risks will be greater. The potential for profit or loss from
        transactions on foreign Markets or in foreign currency will be affected
        by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Such enhanced risks include
        the risks of political or economic policy charges in a foreign media,
        which may substantially and permanently alter the conditions terms,
        Marketability or price of a foreign currency.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Risk mitigating orders or strategies<br/>
        The placing of certain orders (e.g. "Stop Loss" or "Stop Limits" orders)
        that are intended to limit losses to certain amounts, are not
        guaranteed. Such strategies may not always be affected because Market
        conditions or technological limitations may make it impossible to
        execute such orders.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Prices<br/>
        The prices quoted may not necessarily reflect the broader Market. We
        will select closing prices to be used in determining Margin requirements
        and in periodically marking to Market the positions in Client accounts.
        Although we expect that these prices will be reasonably related to those
        available on what is known as the interbank Market, prices we use may
        vary from those available to banks and other participants in the
        interbank Market. Consequently, we may exercise considerable discretion
        in setting Margin requirements and collecting Margin funds.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Weekend risk<br/>
        Various situations, developments or events may arise over a weekend when
        currency, Commodity and other Markets generally close for trading, that
        may cause the Markets to open at a significantly different price from
        where they closed on Friday afternoon. Our Clients will not be able to
        use the electronic communication systems to place or change orders over
        the weekend and at other times when the Markets are generally closed.
        There is a substantial risk that stop-loss orders, which are not
        guaranteed, applied to manage the risk to open positions held over the
        weekend will be executed at levels significantly worse than their
        specified price and you may be liable for making good any losses, even
        if they are unforeseen.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Electronic trading<br/>
        The use of electronic trading systems, Platforms and communication

        associated with the system or Platform including the failure of hardware
        and software systems or network down-timed access or connection
        failures.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Contingent liability transactions<br/>
        Such transactions are margined, requiring you to make a series of
        payments against the purchase price, instead of paying the whole
        purchase price immediately. You may sustain a total loss of the Margin
        you deposit with your
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        dealer to establish or maintain a position. If the Market moves against
        you, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional Margin at
        short notice to maintain the position. If you fail to do so within the
        time required, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be
        liable for any resulting deficit. Even if the transaction is not
        margined, it may still carry an obligation to make further payments in
        certain circumstances over and above any amount paid when you entered
        into the contract. Contingent liability transactions, which are not
        traded on or under the rules of a recognized or designated investment
        exchange, may expose you to substantially greater risks.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Collateral<br/>
        If you deposit collateral as security, you should ascertain how your
        collateral will be dealt with. Deposited collateral may lose its
        identity as your property once dealings on your behalf are undertaken.
        Even if your dealings should ultimately prove profitable, you may not
        get back the same assets, which you deposited and may have to accept
        payment in cash.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Commissions<br/>
        Before you begin to trade, you should obtain details of all commissions
        and other charges for which you will be liable from the STARTRADER
        website or enquire at info@startrader.com. If any charges are not
        expressed in money terms (but, for example, as a dealing spread), you
        should obtain a clear written explanation, including appropriate
        examples, to establish what such charges are likely to mean in specific

        4. Dividends
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          4.1. Where applicable (e.g. where an Instrument is a stock or a share
          in respect of which a dividend is paid) a dividend adjustment will be
          calculated. A dividend adjustment will be calculated for your account
          in respect of open positions held on the ex-dividend day for the
          relevant underlying instrument.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        4.2. For long positions, the dividend adjustment will generally be a
        cash adjustment reflecting the amount of the net dividend receivable.
        For short positions, the dividend adjustment will generally be a cash
        adjustment payable reflecting the pre-tax dividend amount, unless
        otherwise agreed.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        4.3. Adjustments reflecting dividends will be credited to your account
        if you bought (opened a long position) and debited from your account if
        you sold (opened a short position)
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        4.4. Some markets where we offer share CFDs contain a dividend element
        which is forecasted by us. In the event that the declared dividend is
        unusually large, small or cancelled or the ex-dividend date differs from
        our forecasted ex-dividend date, we reserve the right to make an
        adjustment to accounts to reflect such differences, provided any such
        adjustment must be fair and reasonable.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
        <span class="indent"></span>
        4.5. In the event that a dividend provides the clients with a choice
        (example: to choose between receiving different currencies) we will,
        usually apply the default option to the accounts unless otherwise
        advised.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        In the event that a dividend provides the clients with a choice of cash

        6. If the underlying market of a share CFD instrument becomes suspended
        we reserve the right to margin all associated Trades at 100% and value
        the market appropriately. This may mean your Trade being either valued
        at zero or at the last price held in our Market at the time of
        suspension.

          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.1 STARTRADER Limited attaches different levels of regulatory
          protection to each category and hence to Clients within each category.
          In particular, Retail Clients are afforded the most regulatory
          protection; Professional Clients are considered to be more
          experienced, knowledgeable and sophisticated and able to assess their
          own risk and are thus afforded fewer regulatory protections.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.2 STARTRADER Limited offers its Clients the possibility to request
          reclassification online and thus to increase or decrease the level of
          regulatory protections afforded. Where a Client requests a different
          categorization (either on an overall level or on a product level), the
          Client needs to meet certain specified quantitative and qualitative
          criteria.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.3 On the basis of the Client's request, STARTRADER Limited
          undertakes an adequate assessment of the expertise, experience, and
          knowledge of the Client to give reasonable assurance, in the light of
          the nature of transactions or services envisaged that the Client is
          capable of making his/her own investment decisions and understanding
          the risks involved. However, if the above-mentioned criteria are not
          met, STARTRADER Limited reserves the right to choose whether to
          provide services under the requested classification.

            Clients for any loss, expense, cost or liability suffered or
            incurred by the Client due to failure of the system, transmission

            Client. Due to delayed transmission between the Client and
            STARTRADER Limited the price offered by STARTRADER Limited may have
            changed before an order from the Client is received by STARTRADER
            Limited. If automatic order execution is offered to the Client,
            STARTRADER Limited shall be entitled to change the price on which
            the Client's order is executed to the market value at the time at

            execution of an order or instruction regarding a Contract Option to
            the execution of the relevant exchange traded product on the
            exchange, the price as listed on the Trading Platform is subject to
            change, in order for the Contract Option to reflect the price of the
            relevant exchange traded product at the time of its execution or

            that a Contract is executed immediately when the Client transmits
            instructions via the Trading Platform, it is the Settlement/Trade
            Confirmation forwarded by STARTRADER Limited or made available to
            the Client on the Trading Platform which solely constitutes
            STARTRADER Limited's confirmation of execution.

          Client shall only be deemed to have been received and shall only then
          constitute a valid instruction and/or binding Contract between
          STARTRADER Limited and the Client when such instruction has been
          recorded as executed by STARTRADER Limited and confirmed by STARTRADER
          Limited to the Client through the Settlement/Trade Confirmation and/or
          Account Statement, and the mere transmission of an instruction by the
          Client shall not constitute a binding Contract between STARTRADER
          Limited and the Client.

          <span class="indent"></span>
          5.5 The Client shall promptly give any instructions to STARTRADER
          Limited, which STARTRADER Limited may require. If the Client does not
          give such instructions promptly, STARTRADER Limited may, at its
          reasonable discretion, take such steps at the Client's cost, as
          STARTRADER Limited considers necessary or desirable for its own
          protection or the protection of the Client. This provision is
          similarly applicable in situations when STARTRADER Limited is unable
          to obtain contact with the Client.

          its intention to exercise an option, a Contract Option or another
          Contract which requires an instruction from the Client at the time
          stipulated by STARTRADER Limited, STARTRADER Limited may treat the
          option or Contract as abandoned by the Client. If the Client wishes to
          exercise an option, Contract Option or another Contract, the Client
          must provide STARTRADER Limited with notice thereof in reasonable time
          (and within applicable cut-off times) for STARTRADER Limited to
          exercise the corresponding right under any contract equivalent to the
          Contract Option that STARTRADER Limited has entered into with any
          Counterparty. Contract Options (put and call) that close one tick or
          more in the money on the last trading day will automatically be
          exercised, regardless of whether the Client has purchased or sold the
          Contract Option. The Client cannot instruct STARTRADER Limited not to
          exercise Contract Options that are in the money at expiry and cannot
          at any time instruct STARTRADER Limited to exercise Contract Options
          that are out of the money.

          5.7 STARTRADER Limited applies a random method of assignment among its
          Clients' Contract Options when STARTRADER Limited is notified by its
          Counterparties that one or more short option positions have been
          assigned. STARTRADER Limited’s allocation method randomly selects
          short Contract Options among all STARTRADER Limited’s Clients'
          positions, including Contract Options opened immediately prior to the
          assignment. All short Contract Options are liable for assignment at
          any time. If a short Contract Option is assigned, the Client is
          obliged, within the applicable time of delivery, to deliver the
          relevant amount of cash or assets in the case of a call Contract
          Option and the relevant amount of cash in the case of a put Contract
          Option, to effect settlement.

          5.8 STARTRADER Limited may (but shall not in any circumstances be
          obliged to) require confirmation in such form as STARTRADER Limited
          may reasonably request if an instruction is to close an Account or
          remit money due to the Client or if it appears to STARTRADER Limited
          that such confirmation is necessary or desirable.

          explicitly or tacit power of attorney to give STARTRADER Limited

          to cancel, unwind, close out, repair, reinstate or take other action
          it may deem necessary with respect to open or closed trades of Client
          or instructions from the Client where the trades executed or
          instructions submitted would be in violation of, but not limited to,
          the Agreement, securities markets legislation, usual market practices,
          legislation on money laundering or insider trading or if the Client is
          using or has otherwise engaged proprietary or third party malicious
          and manipulative software or plugins or general trading style that in
          STARTRADER Limited’s, its eligible counterparties' or liquidity
          providers' view, has the actual, suspected or potential nature of
          breaching the Agreement or relevant securities markets legislation or
          STARTRADER Limited believes that to execute its absolute discretion
          with the regards to the above matters is necessary to protect its own
          interests, or the interests of its Clients.

          instructions as soon as practically possible and shall, as far as
          trading instructions are concerned, act consistent with the broker's
          Best Execution Policy. However, if after instructions are received,
          STARTRADER Limited believes that it is not reasonably practicable to
          act upon such instructions within a reasonable time, STARTRADER
          Limited may defer acting upon those instructions until it is, in
          STARTRADER Limited’s reasonable opinion, practicable to do so or as
          soon as possible notify the Client that STARTRADER Limited is refusing
          to act upon such instructions.

          5.12 It is possible that errors may occur in the prices of
          transactions quoted by STARTRADER Limited. In such circumstances,
          without prejudice to any rights it may have, STARTRADER Limited shall
          not be bound by any Contract which purports to have been made (whether
          or not confirmed by STARTRADER Limited) at a price which:

          Limited can document that there on the time of theconclusion of the
          trade were errors in prices, commissions, or in the Trading Platform,

          based on its trading strategy or other provable behavior, deliberate
          and/or systematically has exploited or attempted to exploit such an
          error, STARTRADER Limited is entitled to take one or more of the

          it to be desirable or necessary to disclose such information in any
          dispute or anticipated dispute between STARTRADER Limited and the
          Client. However, technical reasons may prevent STARTRADER Limited from
          recording a conversation, and recordings or transcripts made by
          STARTRADER Limited will be destroyed in accordance with STARTRADER
          Limited’s normal practice. Consequently, the Client should not rely on
          such recordings to be available.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">

          8.2. STARTRADER Limited’s margin requirement shall apply throughout
          the term of the Margin Trade. It is the Client's responsibility
          continuously to ensure that sufficient margin is available on the
          Account at any time. If practicably possible STARTRADER Limited shall

          Trade at its discretion but only at the Client's instruction or
          according to STARTRADER Limited's rights under this Agreement.
          However, STARTRADER Limited will increase the margin requirements if
          STARTRADER Limited considers that its risk on a Margin Trade has
          increased as compared to the risk on the date of the opening.

          14.1. When STARTRADER Limited executes orders as Agent for the Client
          on a recognized stock or futures exchange, STARTRADER Limited will not
          be a party to such a trade as such orders will be executed in the
          trading system of the relevant exchange at the best price and the most
          favorable conditions available at the time of the order or according
          to the Client's specific instructions, e.g. in a situation where the
          Client has chosen to limit the order. STARTRADER Limited will not
          include any additional spread in the price of the execution achieved
          for the Client but will be remunerated according to the Commissions,
          Charges & Margin Schedule.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.2. The Client is specifically made aware that in certain markets,
          including the foreign exchange markets, OTC foreign exchange options
          and CFD Contracts, STARTRADER Limited may act as a Market Maker.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.3. When acting as a Market Maker, STARTRADER Limited will under
          normal market circumstances quote the Client bid and ask prices.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.4. In order for STARTRADER Limited to quote prices with the
          swiftness normally associated with speculative trading, STARTRADER
          Limited may have to rely on available price or availability
          information that may later prove to be faulty due to specific market
          circumstances, for instance, but not limited to, lack of liquidity in
          or suspension of an asset or errors in feeds from information
          providers or quotes from Counterparties. If so and if STARTRADER
          Limited has acted in good faith when providing the price to the
          Client, STARTRADER Limited may cancel the trade with the Client but
          shall do so within reasonable time and shall provide the Client with a
          full explanation for the reason for such cancellation.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.5. Following execution of any position with a Client, STARTRADER
          Limited may at STARTRADER Limited's reasonable discretion subsequently
          offset each such client position with another client position, or a
          position with one of STARTRADER Limited's Counterparties or retain a
          proprietary position in the market with the intention to obtain
          trading profits from such positions. Such decisions and actions may
          therefore result in STARTRADER Limited off- setting client positions
          at prices different (sometimes significantly different) from prices
          quoted to clients, resulting in trading profits or losses for
          STARTRADER Limited. This in turn can raise the possibility of the
          Client incurring what may be seen as an implied cost (i.e. the
          difference between the price at which the Client traded with
          STARTRADER Limited and the price at which STARTRADER Limited
          subsequently traded with Counterparties and/or other clients) due to
          any profits realized by STARTRADER Limited as a result of the Market
          Making function. However, the Market Making function may involve
          significant costs to STARTRADER Limited if the market moves against
          STARTRADER Limited as compared to the price at which STARTRADER
          Limited traded with the Client.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.6. The Client accepts that STARTRADER Limited in such markets where
          STARTRADER Limited acts as Market Maker, may hold positions that are
          contrary to positions of the Client, resulting in potential conflicts
          of interest between STARTRADER Limited and the Client, cf. Clause 16.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.7. In markets, where STARTRADER Limited acts as a Market Maker, the
          Client accepts that STARTRADER Limited has no obligation to quote
          prices to clients at all times in any given market, nor to quote such
          prices to clients with a specific maximum spread.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.8. In markets, where STARTRADER Limited acts as a Market Maker,
          STARTRADER Limited may or may not charge commissions. However,
          irrespective of whether or not STARTRADER Limited charges any
          commissions, the Client accepts that STARTRADER Limited will seek to
          make additional profits out of its performance as a Market Maker and
          the size of any such profits may be considerable if and when compared
          with the Client's margin deposit.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.9. The Client acknowledges, recognizes and accepts that the price
          quoted to the Client includes a spread when compared with the price to
          which STARTRADER Limited may have covered or expected to be able to
          cover the Contract in a trade with another client or a Counterparty.
          Furthermore, the Client acknowledges, recognizes and accepts that said
          spread constitutes remuneration to STARTRADER Limited and that such
          spread not necessarily can be calculated for all Contracts and that
          such spread will not be specified at the Settlement/Trade Confirmation
          or otherwise revealed to the Client.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.10. The Client acknowledges, recognizes and accepts that STARTRADER
          Limited quotes variable spreads on options. The Client is specifically
          made aware that variable option spreads are affected by actual market
          conditions, which are beyond STARTRADER Limited’s control. STARTRADER
          Limited does not guarantee any maximum or minimum quotable option
          spreads.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.11. Any commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and
          included in the spreads quoted by STARTRADER Limited as a Market Maker
          in certain markets and other fees and charges will consequently
          influence the Client's trading result and will have a negative effect
          on the Client's trading performance compared to a situation if such
          commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included
          in the spreads did not apply.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.12. Whilst dealing spreads and commissions are normally considered
          moderate seen in relation to the value of the assets traded, such
          costs may be considerable when compared with the Client's margin
          deposit. As a consequence thereof the Client's margin deposit may be
          depleted by trading losses that the Client may incur and by the
          directly visible dealing costs such as commissions, interest charges
          and brokerage fees as well as the said not visible costs for the
          Client, caused by STARTRADER Limited's performance as a Market Maker.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.13. If the Client is an active trader and is undertaking numerous
          transactions, the total impact of as well visible as not visible costs
          may be significant. Consequently, the Client may have to obtain
          significant profits in the markets in order to cover the costs
          associated with trading activities with STARTRADER Limited. For very
          active Clients, such costs may over time exceed the value of the
          margin deposited. Normally, when trading margined derivatives, the
          lower the percentage of the applicable margin rate, the higher the
          proportion of the costs associated with executing a transaction.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.14. The Client is specifically made aware that in the area of
          market making in foreign exchange, OTC foreign exchange options, CFD
          Contracts and other OTC products, significant implied costs can arise
          as a consequence of the profits made by STARTRADER Limited performing
          in its capacity as a Market Maker.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.15. STARTRADER Limited's performance as a Market Maker may
          negatively affect the Client's Account with STARTRADER Limited and the
          said implied costs are neither directly visible nor directly
          quantifiable for the Client at any time.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.16. STARTRADER Limited is at no time obliged to disclose any
          details of its performance or income produced as a Market Maker or
          otherwise related to other commissions, charges and fees.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          14.17. The Client is specifically made aware that CFD Contracts may be
          OTC products quoted by STARTRADER Limited whilst operating as a Market
          Maker and not traded on a recognized stock exchange. As a result, the
          description above of the implied, not visible costs related to
          STARTRADER Limited's performance as a Market Maker may also apply to
          any CFD Contract.

          15.1. STARTRADER Limited is in accordance with the broker's Best
          Execution Policy entitled to aggregate the Client's orders with the
          broker's own orders, orders of any of the broker's associates and/or
          persons connected with STARTRADER Limited including employees and
          other clients. Furthermore, STARTRADER Limited may split the Client's
          orders when executing these. The orders will only be aggregated or
          split if STARTRADER Limited reasonably believes it to be in the best
          interest of the Client. On some occasion’s aggregation and split of
          the Client's order may result in the Client obtaining a less favorable
          price than if the Client's orders had been executed respectively
          separately or mutually.

          or arrangement that is material in relation to any transaction or
          Contract effected, or advice provided by STARTRADER Limited, under

          character and/or background of any conflict of interest) the Client

          discretion and STARTRADER Limited shall do so where the transaction is

          Introducing Broker. If so, STARTRADER Limited shall not be responsible
          for any agreement made between the Client and the Client's Introducing
          Broker. The Client acknowledges that any such Introducing Broker will
          either be acting as an independent intermediary or an Agent for the
          Client and that no such Introducing Broker shall be authorized to make
          any representations concerning STARTRADER Limited or STARTRADER

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">

          for the client because the Introducing Broker can deduct commissions
          and fees as well as price or interest/financing rate adjustments for

          STARTRADER Limited over a Margin Trade or alleged Margin Trade or any
          instruction relating to a Margin Trade, STARTRADER Limited is entitled
          at its reasonable discretion and without notice to close any such
          Margin Trade or alleged Margin Trade if STARTRADER Limited reasonably
          believes such action to be desirable for the purpose of limiting the
          maximum amount involved in the dispute. STARTRADER Limited shall not
          be responsible to the Client in connection with any subsequent
          fluctuations in the level of the relevant Margin Trade. If STARTRADER
          Limited closes a Margin Trade under this Clause such action shall be
          without prejudice to STARTRADER Limited’s right to contend that such
          Margin Trade had already been closed by STARTRADER Limited or was
          never opened by the Client. STARTRADER Limited shall take reasonable
          steps to inform the Client that STARTRADER Limited has taken such
          action as soon as practicable after doing so. Where STARTRADER Limited
          closes a Margin Trade or alleged Margin Trade in accordance with this
          Clause, the closing shall be without prejudice to the Client's rights
          to open a new Margin Trade, provided that such Margin Trade is opened
          in accordance with this Agreement. When calculating margin or other

          1.1 Effect of "Leverage" or "Gearing"<br/>
          Transactions in foreign exchange and derivatives carry a high degree
          of risk. The amount of initial margin may be small relative to the
          value of the foreign exchange or derivatives contract so that
          transactions are "leveraged" or "geared". A relatively small market
          movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you
          have deposited or will have to deposit; this may work against you as
          well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds
          and any additional funds deposited with STARTRADER Limited to maintain
          your position. If the market moves against your position and/or margin
          requirements are increased, you may be called upon to deposit
          additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. Failing to
          comply with a request for a deposit of additional funds, may result in
          closure of your position(s) by STARTRADER Limited on your behalf and
          you will be liable for any resulting loss or deficit.

          1.2 Risk-reducing Orders or Strategies<br/>
          The placing of certain orders (e.g. "stop-loss" orders, where
          permitted under local law, or "stop-limit" orders), which are intended
          to limit losses to certain amounts, may not be adequate given that
          markets conditions make it impossible to execute such orders, e.g. due
          to illiquidity in the market. Strategies using combinations of
          positions, such as "spread" and "straddle"' positions may be as risky
          as taking simple "long" or "short" positions.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          2.1. Variable Degree of Risk Transactions in options carry a high
          degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of options should familiarize
          themselves with the type of option (i.e., put or call) which they
          contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate the
          extent to which the value of the options must increase for your
          position to become profitable, taking into account the premium and all
          transaction costs. The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the
          options or allow the option to expire. The exercise of an option
          results either in a cash settlement or in the purchaser acquiring or
          delivering the underlying interest. If the option is on a future, the
          purchaser will acquire a futures position with associated liabilities
          for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the purchased option
          is out-of- the-money when it expires, you will suffer a total loss of
          your investment, which will consist of the option premium plus
          transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing out-of-the-
          money options, you should be aware that the chance of such options
          becoming profitable ordinarily is remote.<br/><br/>
          Selling ("writing" or "granting") an option generally entails
          considerably greater risk than purchasing options. Although the
          premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss
          well in excess of that amount. The seller will be liable for
          additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves
          unfavorably. The seller will also be exposed to the risk of the
          purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to
          either settle the option in cash or to acquire or deliverthe
          underlying interest. If the option is on a future, the seller will
          acquire a position in a future with associated liabilities for margin
          (see the section on Futures above). If the option is "covered" by the
          seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying asset, in a
          future or in another option, the risk may be reduced. In case the
          option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited.<br/><br/>
          Certain exchanges in some jurisdictions permit deferred payment of the
          option premium, exposing the purchaser to liability for margin
          payments not exceeding the amount of the premium. The purchaser is
          still subject to the risk of losing the premium and transaction costs.
          When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible
          for any unpaid premium outstanding at that time.

          3.1. Terms and Conditions of Contracts<br/>
          You should ask the firm with which you deal about the terms and
          conditions of the Contracts entered into and information on associated
          obligations (e.g. the circumstances under which you may become
          obligated to make or take delivery of the underlying interest of a
          futures contract and, in respect of options, expiration dates and
          restrictions on the time for exercise). Under certain circumstances
          the specifications of outstanding contracts (including the exercise
          price of an option) may be modified by the exchange or clearing house
          to reflect changes in the underlying interest.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.2. Suspension or Restriction of Trading and Pricing Relationships<br/>
          Market condition (e.g. illiquidity) and/or the operation of the rules
          of certain markets (e.g., the suspension of trading in any contract or
          contract month because of price limits or "circuit breakers") may
          increase the risk of loss by making it difficult or impossible to
          effect transactions or close/ offset positions. If you have sold
          options, this may increase the risk of loss.<br/><br/>
          Normal pricing relationships between the underlying asset and a
          derivative do not always exist. The absence of an underlying reference
          price may make it difficult to judge "fair" value.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.3. Deposited Cash and Property<br/>
          You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded the
          Security you deposit by way of money or other assets in domestic and
          foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency
          or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover your money or other
          assets is governed by the legislation and local rules in the country
          at which location the counterparty acts.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.4. Commission and Other Charges<br/>
          Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of
          all commission, fees and other charges for which you will be liable.
          These charges will affect your net profit or loss.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.5. Transactions in Other Jurisdictions<br/>
          Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets
          formally linked to a domestic market, may expose you to additional
          risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation, which may offer
          different or diminished investor protection. Your local regulatory
          authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of
          regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your
          transactions have been effected.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.6. Currency Risks<br/>
          The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated
          contracts in another currency than your account currency will be
          affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to
          convert from the currency denomination of the contract to the account
          currency.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.7. Trading Facilities<br/>
          Most open-outcry and electronic trading facilities are supported by
          computer-based component systems for the order-routing, execution,
          matching, registration or clearing of trades. As with all facilities
          and systems, they are vulnerable to temporary disruption or failure.
          Your ability to recover certain losses may be subject to limits on
          liability imposed by the system provider, the market, the clearing
          house and/or member firms. Such limits may vary: you should ask the
          firm with which you deal for details in this respect.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.8. Electronic Trading<br/>
          Trading on an electronic trading system may differ not only from
          trading in an open- outcry market but also from trading on other
          electronic trading systems. If you undertake transactions on an
          electronic trading system, you will be exposed to risks associated
          with the system including the failure of hardware and software. The
          result of any system failure may be that your order is either not
          executed according to your instructions, is not executed at all and a
          lack of capability to keep you informed continuously about your
          positions and fulfillment of the margin requirements.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          3.9. Off-Exchange Transactions<br/>
          In some jurisdictions firms are permitted to effect off-exchange
          transactions. The firm with which you deal may be acting as your
          counterpart to the transaction. It may be difficult or impossible to
          liquidate an existing position, to assess the value, to determine a
          fair price or to assess the exposure to risk. For these reasons, these
          transactions may involve increased risks. Off-exchange transactions
          may be less regulated or subject to a separate regulatory regime.
          Before you undertake such transactions, you should familiarize
          yourself with applicable rules and attendant risks.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          a. Where applicable (e.g. where an Instrument is a stock or a share in
          respect of which a dividend is paid) a dividend adjustment will be
          calculated. A dividend adjustment will be calculated for your account
          in respect of open positions held on the ex-dividend day for the
          relevant underlying instrument.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          b. For long positions, the dividend adjustment will generally be a
          cash adjustment reflecting the amount of the net dividend receivable.
          For short positions, the dividend adjustment will generally be a cash
          adjustment payable reflecting the pre-tax dividend amount, unless
          otherwise agreed.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          c. Adjustments reflecting dividends will be credited to the clients’
          account if they bought (opened a long position) and debited from their
          account if they sold (opened a short position)
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          d. Some markets where STARTRADER Limited offers share CFDs contain a
          dividend element which is forecasted by the Company. In the event that
          the declared dividend is unusually large, small or cancelled or the
          ex-dividend date differs from the Company’s forecasted ex-dividend
          date, STARTRADER Limited reserves the right to make an adjustment to
          accounts to reflect such differences, provided any such adjustment
          must be fair and reasonable.

        <div class="paragraph indent-parent">
          <span class="indent"></span>
          e. In the event that a dividend provides the clients with a choice
          (example: to choose between receiving different currencies),
          STARTRADER Limited will usually apply the default option to the
          accounts unless otherwise advised.

          right to amend the Guaranteed Stop price by the size of the dividend
          adjustment.
